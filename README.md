<h1>Guessing Game in Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Guessing Game! This is a simple Python project where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It's a fun way to practice Python programming, particularly working with loops, conditionals, and basic input/output operations.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>The game randomly selects a number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 100).</b> 
- <b>The player has to guess the number.</b>
- <b>After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.</b> 
- <b>The game keeps track of the number of attempts made by the player.</b>
- <b>The player can choose to play again after guessing the number correctly.</b>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

1. <b>Run the 'NumberGuessingGame.py' script.</b>
2. <b>The game will prompt you to guess a number within a specified range.</b>
3. <b>Enter your guess and press Enter.</b>
4. <b>The game will inform you if your guess is too low, too high, or correct.</b>
5. <b>Keep guessing until you find the correct number.</b>
6. <b>After winning, you can choose to play again or exit the game.</b>

<h2>Code Overview</h2>

<b>The main components of the Guessing Game are:</b>
- <b>Random Number Generation: Uses Python's 'random' module to generate a random number.</b>
- <b>User Input: Takes input from the user for their guesses.</b>
- <b>Feedback: Provides feedback to the user about their guesses (too low, too high, correct).</b>
- <b>Game Loop: Repeats the guessing process until the correct number is guessed and allows replaying.</b>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
